# Smart-Parking-System
A web-based system that manages vehicle parking
It is centrally controlled hence suitable for admininstration purposes e.g at the gate by security personnel
The user can sign-up, login, book a parking slot for the driver and give them a card with the slot number on it.
The slot is then marked as occupied until the driver returns the card as they leave after which the space is freed.
